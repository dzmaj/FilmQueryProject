## Film Query Project
### Overview and Lessons Learned
The program makes use of JDBC to access data in a MySQL database server. There are two types of searches the user can do, which pull data from several different tables and put them into java objects to display data to the user.

The main things I learned were how to work with JDBC and retrieve data using SQL queries. I didn't quite have time to work through all the stretch goals, but was able to add the film categories and the option to display more/less film details.
